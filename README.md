# QMC_LO_basis

Hello !

This is the source code for the real-time Quantum Monte Carlo project formulated
in the LO basis, as part of the TRIQS project: github.com/TRIQS/triqs.

This project was achieved together with Priyanka Seth, Michel
Ferrero and Olivier Parcollet. You can find the original research paper describing
the algorithm and the formalism here:
https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.085125
More details are available in my PhD manuscript:
https://theses.fr/2020IPPAX026

This code was developed during my PhD under the supervision of Antoine Georges
and Michel Ferrero, at Coll√®ge de France (Paris), Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau)
and Flatiron Institute (New York).
Several Monte Carlo moves and updates are available, depending on the groupings
of determinants considered (see PhD manuscript for more details).
Note that the code is not maintained anymore.
